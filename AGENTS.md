# AGENT Instructions

This repository is now a Rust workspace.

- Install the stable Rust toolchain before running tests.
- Run tests with `cargo test` from the repository root.
- Format with `cargo fmt` when possible.
- Ensure the `rustfmt` component is installed so formatting can run offline.
- Crate `pete` depends on the local `psyche` crate.
- Keep examples and inline docs up to date with code changes.
- When adding binary arguments or library APIs, update tests accordingly.
